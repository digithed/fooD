# fooD
FooD (pun on the word "foodie") is a restaurant + social media ReactJS, Express,and Google Firebase web applicaiton. I started building this at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to see what restuarants in Boston were still delivering food. As time went on I began to have fun with the idea of adding a social aspect to the app, and liked the idea of having a better recorded history of a fun night out.

## How to build and run the app

Install yarn and node if you don't have them already with `brew install yarn` and `brew install node`.

Next, install nodemon with `npm install nodemon`.

To run the front-end React server run `yarn start` while in the root of the cloned directory. To run the Express server run `nodemon server.js` while in the /src directory. The server will listen on localhost port 3001.
